[https://pockethost.io](https://pockethost.io) and [PocketHost](https://github.com/pockethost/pockethost), the open source, _zero-config / up-in-30-seconds_, multitenant PocketBase server, have reached v0.10.0.

This is a catch-up release as we make our way toward v1.0.0. I couldn't find a good place to tag a release, and it got way behind!

Getting back on track with release tags is also important because we are working on CLI tool (npm package) that will make PocketHost way easier to self-host. That will need better change management and versioning than what I've been doing.

In other news, pockethost.io users have contributed over $20k in a grass-roots lifetime membership drive to keep pockethost.io running for years to come. Those funds are held in trust to cover hosting fees. I don't pay myself. Also, 10% goes back to PocketBase and PocketHost core contributors. I am really thankful and touched by those of you who placed your confidence in seeing PocketHost thrive. Though we may not know what a 'lifetime membership' even means, 100 of you bought one. ðŸ’š

Also a big thank you to [PocketHost contributors](https://github.com/pockethost/pockethost/graphs/contributors). You guys are really coming through while I'm down in the trenches keeping servers running. Onward! :)

I also want to mention the thriving Discord community. We have over 500 members and many daily active users who discuss PocketBase programming topics as well as get support for PocketHost. If you want to really feel a sense of vibrancy, it's happing in [our Discord community](https://discord.gg/HsSjcuPRWX).

# Overview (experimental)

Here is what AI thinks we did based on the change log (powered by [rizzdown](https://benallfree/rizzdown))...

> Version 0.10.0 of PocketHost is a consolidation of numerous minor enhancements and bug fixes positioned to enhance stability as the platform gears up for v1.0. Among the notable enhancements, the inclusion of the â€˜BLOG_DOMAINâ€™ support and â€˜PUBLIC_EDGE_APEX_DOMAINâ€™ provides increased capabilities for project hosting and configuration. Integrated availability checks streamline the user experience for developers, while additional type checking in the linting process should safeguard the output quality.
>
> The incremental improvements to the PocketHost system extends to the interactive dashboard. Adjustments to the environment variable updates, guards, and state management have enriched its functionality, optimizing user interaction while reinforcing the platform's vigorous security measures.
>
> From the bug perspective, the fixes span a wide range. Concerns around the security in the Dashboard have been addressed. Tackling everything from the Docker file working directory to account confirmation TS errors optimizes the system's performance and reliability. Smaller, more aesthetic changes have been executed, like fixing broken links or correcting typos, reflecting a commitment to not overlook minute details for the sake of larger components. This commitment to creating a seamless, high-quality user experience for developers aligns with the core ethos of PocketHost.
